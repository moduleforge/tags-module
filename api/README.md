# tags-api

Go service and HTTP router for the tags-module. This module exposes
tx-aware tag CRUD operations via `service` (business logic layer) and
mounts a chi subrouter for REST endpoints via `httpapi`. It depends on
`tags-model` for generated database access, and `core-api`/`core-model`
for shared entity primitives. Business logic and route implementations
land in Phase 3; this package is a clean skeleton only.
